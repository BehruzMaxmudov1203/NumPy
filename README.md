Imported the NumPy library and demonstrated key functionality

Created 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays and analyzed their properties (shape, dtype, size)

Accessed array elements using indexing and slicing

Generated random arrays using np.random module

Performed arithmetic and logical operations on arrays

Applied shape manipulation functions such as reshape, resize, and ravel

Used functions like np.where, np.argmax, and np.argmin for array querying

Utilized statistical functions like np.sum, np.mean, and np.std

Performed matrix operations: dot, inner, outer, matmul

Saved and loaded arrays using np.save, np.savetxt, and np.load

Implemented a custom class with __iter__ and __next__ for iteration over arrays
